#  :laptop: Instruction to run Welcome Assignment code for Sakshi Jaiswal!:girl::icecream:

This is our first assigment for Big Data Analytics we were asked to create a function that would print our name in python.

First we were asked to change the name of the README.md file to instructions.md and create a new README.file ,this file will  explain the work .


To writing the program I decided to use Jupyter Notebook :
1)I created a class called print_name and under this class the function name 'info' displays my name but it could also be used for anyone's.
2)When we run this program it will ask for user input "Enter Your First name " then "enter your last name".
3)Afterthat i am printing greeting message also.

Later I uploaded my assigment with the file called Welcome Sakshi.ipynb


First you have to download jupyter notebook .
Open a new python file write a program
1)I have creted a class name print_name under that i have created a function
