#  :trophy: Instruction to run Welcome Assignment code for Sakshi Jaiswal!:girl::icecream:

##   Introduction
This is our first assigment for Big Data Analytics. We were asked to create a function that would print our name in python.

First we were asked to change the name of the README.md file to instructions.md and create a new README.file ,this file will  explain the work .

### Instruction for setting up the enviornment and executing the program 

For writing the program I decided to use Jupyter Notebook with python 3.6 with kernel

- First we will visit official anaconda site where we can dowload latest anaconda of python 3.6 after downloading latest version of anaconda we will start installer.Here is the link 
https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#windows
After that  anaconda installer will open and we click on launch button of jupyter notebook.
Then We will start jupyter notebook for writing program.

- Click on New then python 3 kernel will open.
- I created a class called print_name and under this class the function name 'info' displays user's name.
- When we execute this program it will ask for user input "Enter Your First name " then "enter your last name".
- Afterthat the program will print greeting message also.

Later I uploaded my assigment with the file called Welcome Sakshi.ipynb
